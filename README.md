# Distance metric learning based on structural neighborhoods for dimensionality reduction and classification performance improvement

This implementation first tries to extract a low dimensional manifold from the input data. Then, it learns the local neighborhood structures and the relationship of the data points in the ambient space based on the adjacencies of the same data points on the embedded low dimensional manifold. Using the local neighborhood relationships extracted from the manifold space, the proposed method learns the distance metric in a way which minimizes the distance between similar data and maximizes their distance from the dissimilar data points.
