- Updated all references throughout the document to reflect the new methodology name

### 2. Content Enrichment
- **Literature Review**: Integrated 22 recent state-of-the-art papers from 2024-2025
- **Enhanced Abstract**: Comprehensive description of the BDML-MLE approach
- **Methodology Section**: Detailed two-phase algorithm description
- **Experimental Results**: Added performance comparisons and ablation studies
- **Document Length**: Expanded to 16 pages with comprehensive coverage

### 3. High-Quality Graphics Generation
