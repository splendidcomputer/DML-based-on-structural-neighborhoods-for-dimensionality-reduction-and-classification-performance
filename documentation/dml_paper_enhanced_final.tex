\begin{abstract}
Distance metric learning (DML) has emerged as a fundamental technique in machine learning for improving classification performance by learning optimal distance functions that bring similar instances closer while pushing dissimilar ones apart. However, traditional DML methods often suffer from computational complexity and scalability issues when dealing with high-dimensional data. This paper presents BDML-MLE (Balanced Distance Metric Learning with Manifold Learning Ensemble), a novel approach that integrates manifold learning techniques with balanced neighborhood-based distance metric learning to address these challenges. Our method leverages the intrinsic low-dimensional structure of high-dimensional data through manifold learning, followed by a balanced distance metric learning phase that maintains both local and global structural relationships. The balanced approach ensures robust performance across diverse datasets by preventing dominance of either local or global neighborhood constraints. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that BDML-MLE achieves superior classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed ensemble approach shows particular effectiveness in handling imbalanced datasets and high-dimensional spaces, making it suitable for real-world applications where traditional DML methods struggle.

\section{Introduction}

Distance metric learning (DML) stands as one of the most fundamental challenges in machine learning, with applications spanning across computer vision, natural language processing, and bioinformatics~\cite{bellet2013survey}. The core objective of DML is to learn a distance function that captures the semantic relationships within data, typically by minimizing distances between similar instances while maximizing distances between dissimilar ones.

Recent advances in 2024-2025 have witnessed significant breakthroughs in DML, including deep metric learning in projected-hypersphere spaces~\cite{xu2025deep}, Riemannian metric learning approaches~\cite{gruffaz2025riemannian}, and broad metric learning systems that achieve fast and efficient discriminative learning~\cite{hu2025broad}. These developments have opened new avenues for addressing long-standing challenges in metric learning while maintaining computational efficiency.

The integration of DML with dimensionality reduction techniques offers a promising solution for maintaining discriminative power while achieving computational efficiency. Recent advances in manifold learning have shown that high-dimensional data often lie on or near lower-dimensional manifolds~\cite{roweis2000nonlinear,tenenbaum2000global}, providing a natural framework for combining DML with structure-preserving dimensionality reduction.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Distance Metric Learning}

Traditional distance metric learning approaches can be broadly categorized into linear and nonlinear methods. Linear methods, exemplified by Large Margin Nearest Neighbor (LMNN)~\cite{weinberger2009distance} and Neighborhood Components Analysis (NCA)~\cite{goldberger2005neighbourhood}, learn a linear transformation of the input space. Recent developments have extended these approaches with deep learning architectures~\cite{xu2025deep} and discriminative learning frameworks~\cite{duan2025discriminative}.

Locally Adaptive Discriminant Analysis (LADA) and its variants focus on learning metrics that adapt to local neighborhood structures~\cite{domeniconi2002locally}. Contemporary research has expanded this concept with survey-based approaches that systematically address the challenges in local metric adaptation~\cite{kertesz2025survey}.

The Information-theoretic Metric Learning (ITML) framework~\cite{yang2006efficient} provides a principled approach to metric learning through information-theoretic constraints. Recent advances have incorporated few-shot learning principles~\cite{shang2024few} to address scenarios with limited training data.

Large Margin Nearest Neighbor (LMNN) learning~\cite{weinberger2008fast} has been particularly influential, with modern extensions incorporating broad metric learning principles~\cite{hu2025broad} and advanced optimization strategies.

\subsection{Manifold Learning Integration}

The integration of manifold learning with distance metric learning has gained significant attention in recent years. Contemporary approaches include metric learning in Riemannian manifolds~\cite{gruffaz2025riemannian} and novel distance-based methods that preserve both local and global structures~\cite{bs2025distance}.

Recent theoretical advances have established connections between manifold learning and metric learning through neighborhood preservation principles~\cite{weinberger2009distance,goldberger2005neighbourhood}. Deep learning approaches have further enhanced these connections through end-to-end learning frameworks~\cite{xu2025deep} and discriminative metric learning systems~\cite{duan2025discriminative}.

\subsection{State-of-the-Art Developments (2024-2025)}

The field has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years, with several key developments shaping the current landscape of distance metric learning. Modern metric learning approaches~\cite{kokkonen2025metric} have introduced novel optimization strategies that significantly improve convergence properties and generalization performance.

\section{Methodology}

Our proposed BDML-MLE (Balanced Distance Metric Learning with Manifold Learning Ensemble) method addresses the limitations of existing approaches through a two-phase process that combines manifold learning with balanced distance metric learning.

The fundamental motivation behind our approach lies in the observation that traditional distance metric learning methods often suffer from the curse of dimensionality and fail to capture the intrinsic structure of high-dimensional data. Classical approaches like k-nearest neighbors~\cite{cover1967nearest} and traditional metric learning~\cite{xing2002distance} become increasingly ineffective as dimensionality increases.

\subsection{Phase 1: Manifold Learning Ensemble}

The first phase of our algorithm employs an ensemble of manifold learning techniques to discover the intrinsic low-dimensional structure of the data. This ensemble approach mitigates the risk of poor manifold estimation by combining multiple perspectives of the data structure.

Recent advances in deep manifold learning~\cite{xu2025deep} have demonstrated the effectiveness of ensemble approaches in capturing complex data structures. Our method builds upon these insights while incorporating Riemannian geometry principles~\cite{gruffaz2025riemannian} and broad metric learning strategies~\cite{hu2025broad}.

The manifold learning ensemble includes:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Principal Component Analysis (PCA)}: Captures global linear structure and provides a baseline for dimensionality reduction~\cite{weinberger2009distance}.
\item \textbf{Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)}: Preserves local neighborhood relationships while reducing dimensionality~\cite{goldberger2005neighbourhood}.
\item \textbf{Isomap}: Maintains geodesic distances in the embedded space, capturing global nonlinear structure.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Phase 2: Balanced Distance Metric Learning}

The second phase learns a distance metric in the reduced-dimensional space that balances local and global neighborhood preservation. This balance is crucial for maintaining both fine-grained local relationships and global data structure.

The balanced objective function incorporates recent advances in metric learning optimization~\cite{pan2025metric} and discriminative learning principles~\cite{duan2025discriminative}:

\begin{equation}
L(\mathbf{M}) = \alpha L_{local}(\mathbf{M}) + (1-\alpha) L_{global}(\mathbf{M}) + \lambda R(\mathbf{M})
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{M}$ is the learned metric matrix, $L_{local}$ and $L_{global}$ represent local and global loss terms respectively, $\alpha$ controls the balance between local and global preservation, and $R(\mathbf{M})$ is a regularization term.

\subsection{Algorithm Description}

The complete BDML-MLE algorithm consists of the following steps:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{BDML-MLE Algorithm}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\REQUIRE Input data $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$, labels $\mathbf{y}$, target dimension $k$, balance parameter $\alpha$
\ENSURE Learned metric $\mathbf{M}$, reduced data $\mathbf{Z}$
\STATE \textbf{Phase 1: Manifold Learning Ensemble}
\STATE Apply PCA: $\mathbf{Z}_{PCA} \leftarrow$ PCA$(\mathbf{X}, k)$
\STATE Apply LLE: $\mathbf{Z}_{LLE} \leftarrow$ LLE$(\mathbf{X}, k)$
\STATE Apply Isomap: $\mathbf{Z}_{Iso} \leftarrow$ Isomap$(\mathbf{X}, k)$
\STATE Combine embeddings: $\mathbf{Z} \leftarrow$ Ensemble$(\mathbf{Z}_{PCA}, \mathbf{Z}_{LLE}, \mathbf{Z}_{Iso})$
\STATE \textbf{Phase 2: Balanced Distance Metric Learning}
\FOR{each iteration $t = 1, 2, \ldots, T$}
\STATE Construct local neighborhood graph $\mathcal{G}_{local}$
\STATE Construct global neighborhood graph $\mathcal{G}_{global}$
\STATE Compute local loss: $L_{local} = \sum_{(i,j) \in \mathcal{G}_{local}} \ell_{local}(i,j)$
\STATE Compute global loss: $L_{global} = \sum_{(i,j) \in \mathcal{G}_{global}} \ell_{global}(i,j)$
\STATE Compute gradient: $\nabla L = \alpha \nabla L_{local} + (1-\alpha) \nabla L_{global} + \lambda \nabla R(\mathbf{M})$
\STATE Update metric: $\mathbf{M}^{(t+1)} \leftarrow \mathbf{M}^{(t)} - \eta \nabla L$
\ENDFOR
\RETURN $\mathbf{M}, \mathbf{Z}$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The ensemble combination strategy leverages the strengths of each manifold learning technique while mitigating their individual weaknesses. This approach aligns with recent developments in broad metric learning~\cite{bs2025distance} and advanced ensemble methods that have shown superior performance in various machine learning tasks.

\section{Experimental Results}

We conducted comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of BDML-MLE against state-of-the-art methods. Our experimental setup follows recent best practices in metric learning evaluation~\cite{gruffaz2025riemannian} and includes both traditional benchmarks and contemporary challenging datasets.

\end{figure}

The performance comparison shown in Figure~\ref{fig:performance_heatmap} demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach across multiple datasets and evaluation metrics.

\subsection{Imbalanced Data Handling}

One of the key strengths of BDML-MLE is its ability to handle imbalanced datasets effectively. The balanced neighborhood approach ensures that minority classes receive adequate representation during the metric learning process.
