\begin{abstract}
Distance metric learning (DML) has emerged as a fundamental technique in pattern recognition and machine learning, significantly impacting the performance of various learning algorithms. This paper presents a comprehensive study of DML algorithms based on structural neighborhoods, integrated with seven state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction methods. We propose Balanced Distance Metric Learning with Manifold Learning Ensemble (BDML-MLE), a novel approach that learns optimal distance metrics by preserving local manifold structure while addressing the critical challenge of imbalanced datasets. The method incorporates recent advances in deep metric learning, Riemannian geometry, and broad metric learning paradigms from 2024-2025 literature. BDML-MLE first extracts low-dimensional manifolds from input data using an ensemble of dimensionality reduction techniques, then learns local neighborhood structures based on adjacencies in the embedded space. Using balanced neighborhood construction that addresses class imbalance, BDML-MLE learns distance metrics that minimize distances between similar data points while maximizing separation from dissimilar ones. Our comprehensive evaluation spans seven dimensionality reduction techniques—Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), Isomap, Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), Kernel PCA, and Autoencoder—combined with three classification algorithms: k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), similarity-based k-NN, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, including the highly imbalanced KDDCup98 dataset, demonstrate superior performance of our approach. The LLE+SVM combination achieves 96.08\% accuracy on the Wine dataset and shows remarkable robustness on imbalanced data. Our dimensional analysis reveals dataset-specific optimal embedding dimensions, and computational efficiency comparisons provide practical deployment guidelines. This work establishes new benchmarks for DML research while providing evidence-based recommendations for practitioners in high-dimensional data analysis.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Distance metric learning (DML) represents one of the fundamental challenges in pattern recognition and machine learning, where the goal is to learn optimal distance functions that enhance the performance of various learning algorithms~\cite{bellet2013survey}. Traditional distance metrics, such as Euclidean distance, assume uniform feature importance and fail to capture the intrinsic geometric structure of complex data manifolds, particularly in high-dimensional spaces where the curse of dimensionality severely impacts performance.

Recent advances in 2024-2025 have witnessed significant breakthroughs in DML, including deep metric learning in projected-hypersphere spaces~\cite{xu2025deep}, Riemannian metric learning approaches~\cite{gruffaz2025riemannian}, and broad metric learning systems that achieve fast and efficient discriminative learning~\cite{hu2025broad}. These developments have opened new avenues for addressing long-standing challenges in metric learning while maintaining computational efficiency.

The integration of DML with dimensionality reduction techniques offers a promising solution for maintaining discriminative power while achieving computational efficiency. Recent advances in manifold learning have shown that high-dimensional data often lie on or near lower-dimensional manifolds~\cite{roweis2000nonlinear,tenenbaum2000global}, providing a natural framework for combining DML with structure-preserving dimensionality reduction.

\subsection{Motivation and Problem Statement}

Despite extensive research in DML, several critical challenges remain unaddressed in the current state-of-the-art:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Imbalanced Data Distributions}: Most existing DML methods fail to handle imbalanced datasets effectively, where some classes are significantly underrepresented~\cite{domeniconi2002locally}. Recent surveys on deep metric learning applications~\cite{kertesz2025survey} highlight this as a persistent challenge.

\item \textbf{Local Structure Preservation}: Traditional approaches often ignore the local geometric structure of data manifolds, leading to suboptimal distance metrics~\cite{yang2006efficient}. The advent of manifold metric learning~\cite{shang2024few} has addressed some aspects, but comprehensive solutions remain elusive.

\item \textbf{Scalability Issues}: Many DML algorithms suffer from computational complexity issues when dealing with large-scale datasets~\cite{weinberger2008fast}. Broad metric learning approaches~\cite{hu2025broad} have shown promise in addressing scalability concerns.

\item \textbf{Multi-relational Data Handling}: The increasing complexity of modern datasets requires handling multi-relational structures~\cite{pan2025metric}, which traditional DML approaches cannot adequately address.

\item \textbf{Limited Comparative Analysis}: Existing studies typically focus on individual methods without comprehensive evaluation across multiple dimensionality reduction techniques and datasets.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Contributions}

This paper makes the following significant contributions to the state-of-the-art:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Novel BDML-MLE Algorithm}: We propose Balanced Distance Metric Learning with Manifold Learning Ensemble, a two-phase approach that combines manifold learning with balanced neighborhood construction to address imbalanced data challenges, incorporating insights from recent Riemannian metric learning research~\cite{gruffaz2025riemannian}.

\item \textbf{Comprehensive State-of-the-Art Analysis}: We present the most extensive comparative study to date, incorporating recent advances from 2024-2025 literature and evaluating seven dimensionality reduction methods across multiple datasets and classification algorithms.

\item \textbf{Imbalanced Data Handling}: Our method explicitly addresses class imbalance by constructing equal-sized similar and dissimilar neighborhoods, ensuring balanced representation while incorporating lessons from multi-label pattern classification advances~\cite{bs2025distance}.

\item \textbf{Enhanced Comparisons}: We provide detailed comparisons with leading DML methods including Large Margin Nearest Neighbor (LMNN)~\cite{weinberger2009distance}, Neighbourhood Components Analysis (NCA)~\cite{goldberger2005neighbourhood}, recent deep metric learning approaches~\cite{xu2025deep}, and discriminative projective dictionary methods~\cite{duan2025discriminative}.

\item \textbf{High-Quality Visual Analysis}: We introduce comprehensive visualizations that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across different scenarios, including manifold preservation, neighborhood structure, and performance comparisons.

\item \textbf{Practical Guidelines}: We derive evidence-based recommendations for method selection based on dataset characteristics, computational constraints, and performance requirements, informed by recent computational complexity analyses~\cite{kokkonen2025metric}.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

\subsection{Distance Metric Learning Foundations}

Distance metric learning has evolved from early work on adaptive nearest neighbor classification~\cite{cover1967nearest} to sophisticated methods that learn problem-specific metrics. The seminal work by Xing et al.~\cite{xing2002distance} introduced the concept of learning Mahalanobis distances with side-information constraints, establishing the foundation for supervised DML.

\subsubsection{Recent Advances in Deep Metric Learning (2024-2025)}

The field has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years, with several breakthrough approaches emerging:

\textbf{Projected-Hypersphere Learning}: Xu et al.~\cite{xu2025deep} introduced deep metric learning in projected-hypersphere space, which maps features extracted from deep learning models into a projected-hypersphere space. This approach addresses limitations of traditional Euclidean spaces and provides better geometric properties for distance computation.

\textbf{Riemannian Metric Learning}: Gruffaz and Sassen~\cite{gruffaz2025riemannian} presented Riemannian metric learning as a generalization of traditional distance metric learning, enabling handling of complex data structures beyond conventional approaches. Their work demonstrates that Riemannian manifolds provide a natural framework for learning metrics that respect the intrinsic geometry of data.

\textbf{Broad Metric Learning}: Hu et al.~\cite{hu2025broad} developed a fast and efficient discriminative metric learning model that addresses computational scalability issues. Their broad learning approach achieves competitive performance with significantly reduced training time.

\subsubsection{Supervised Distance Metric Learning}

Large Margin Nearest Neighbor (LMNN)~\cite{weinberger2009distance} learns a Mahalanobis distance metric for k-NN classification by ensuring that k-nearest neighbors belong to the same class while pushing away differently labeled examples. The method optimizes:

\begin{equation}
\min_M \sum_{i,j \in \mathcal{N}_i} ||x_i - x_j||_M^2 + \lambda \sum_{i,j,l} (1 + ||x_i - x_j||_M^2 - ||x_i - x_l||_M^2)_+
\end{equation}

where $M$ is the Mahalanobis matrix, $\mathcal{N}_i$ represents the target neighbors of point $i$, and $\lambda$ controls the trade-off between objectives.

Neighbourhood Components Analysis (NCA)~\cite{goldberger2005neighbourhood} takes a probabilistic approach, learning a linear transformation that maximizes the expected leave-one-out classification performance on the training set. The objective function is:

\begin{equation}
f(A) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j \in C_i} p_{ij}
\end{equation}

where $p_{ij} = \frac{\exp(-||Ax_i - Ax_j||^2)}{\sum_{k \neq i} \exp(-||Ax_i - Ax_k||^2)}$ and $C_i$ is the set of points with the same class as $x_i$.

\subsubsection{Multi-Relational and Complex Data Structures}

Recent advances have focused on handling increasingly complex data structures:

Pan and Le Capitaine~\cite{pan2025metric} introduced metric learning with multi-relational data, addressing scenarios where data points have multiple types of relationships. Their approach extends traditional DML to handle complex relational structures common in modern applications.

The discriminative projective dictionary pair based broad metric learning system by Duan and Zou~\cite{duan2025discriminative} combines dictionary learning with metric learning, providing enhanced pattern classification capabilities for complex data structures.

\subsection{Dimensionality Reduction Techniques}

\label{fig:manifold_comparison}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Linear Methods}

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) remains the most widely used linear dimensionality reduction technique, finding orthogonal projections that maximize variance. Given the covariance matrix $C = \frac{1}{n-1}X^TX$, PCA computes eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues~\cite{jolliffe2002principal}.

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) incorporates class information by maximizing the ratio of between-class to within-class variance~\cite{belhumeur1997eigenfaces}:

\begin{equation}
W_{LDA} = \arg\max_W \frac{\text{tr}(W^T S_B W)}{\text{tr}(W^T S_W W)}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Nonlinear Manifold Learning}

Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)~\cite{roweis2000nonlinear} preserves local linear relationships by reconstructing each point from its neighbors:

\begin{equation}
\min_W \sum_i ||x_i - \sum_{j \in N(i)} W_{ij} x_j||^2
\end{equation}

subject to $\sum_j W_{ij} = 1$.

Isomap~\cite{tenenbaum2000global} extends classical MDS by preserving geodesic distances along the data manifold, computed using shortest-path algorithms on neighborhood graphs.

Recent manifold learning approaches have incorporated deep learning principles. Shang et al.~\cite{shang2024few} developed few-shot classification based on manifold metric learning, which is particularly relevant for scenarios with limited training data.

\subsection{Imbalanced Learning Challenges}

The problem of imbalanced datasets has received significant attention in machine learning~\cite{he2009learning}. In the context of DML, class imbalance poses unique challenges that have been recently addressed through various approaches:

BS and Mohan~\cite{bs2025distance} investigated distance metric learning techniques for performance improvement of ML-kNN and Ranking-SVM-based multi-label pattern classification. Their work demonstrates that learned distance metrics can significantly improve performance on imbalanced multi-label datasets.

The positioning-based metric learning approach by Kokkonen et al.~\cite{kokkonen2025metric} provides insights into computational efficiency considerations when dealing with large-scale imbalanced datasets.

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

\subsection{Problem Formulation}

Let $X = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be a dataset with corresponding class labels $Y = \{y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n\}$ where $y_i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, c\}$ and $c$ is the number of classes. The goal of DML is to learn a distance metric $d_M: \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$ parameterized by matrix $M \succeq 0$ such that:

\begin{equation}
d_M(x_i, x_j) = \sqrt{(x_i - x_j)^T M (x_i - x_j)}
\end{equation}

The learned metric should satisfy the property that similar points (same class) have smaller distances while dissimilar points (different classes) have larger distances.

\subsection{Balanced Distance Metric Learning with Manifold Learning Ensemble (BDML-MLE)}

Our proposed BDML-MLE algorithm operates in two phases, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:bdml_flowchart}:

\subsubsection{Phase 1: Manifold Learning}

Given the high-dimensional input data $X$, we first apply a dimensionality reduction technique to obtain a low-dimensional embedding $Y = \{y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n\} \subset \mathbb{R}^k$ where $k \ll d$. We consider seven different manifold learning approaches:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Principal Component Analysis (PCA)}: $Y = X W_{PCA}$ where $W_{PCA}$ contains the top-$k$ eigenvectors of the data covariance matrix.

\item \textbf{Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)}: $Y = X W_{LDA}$ where $W_{LDA}$ maximizes between-class scatter while minimizing within-class scatter.

\item \textbf{Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)}: Preserves local neighborhood relationships by finding weights that best reconstruct each point from its neighbors.

\item \textbf{Isomap}: Preserves geodesic distances on the data manifold using shortest-path distances in the neighborhood graph.

\item \textbf{Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)}: Preserves pairwise distances between points in the embedded space.

\item \textbf{Kernel PCA}: Nonlinear extension of PCA using kernel functions to capture nonlinear relationships.

\item \textbf{Autoencoder}: Deep learning-based approach that learns compact representations through encoder-decoder architecture.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Phase 2: Balanced Neighborhood Construction}

Inspired by recent advances in handling imbalanced data~\cite{bs2025distance}, we construct balanced neighborhoods in the embedded space $Y$. For each point $y_i$, we define:

\textbf{Similar Neighborhood}: $\mathcal{S}_i = \{j : y_j \in \text{k-NN}(y_i) \text{ and } y_j = y_i\}$

\textbf{Dissimilar Neighborhood}: $\mathcal{D}_i = \{j : y_j \neq y_i\}$

To address class imbalance, we ensure $|\mathcal{S}_i| = |\mathcal{D}_i| = k$ by:
1. Sampling the $k$ nearest same-class neighbors for $\mathcal{S}_i$
2. Randomly sampling $k$ points from different classes for $\mathcal{D}_i$

This balanced construction prevents bias towards majority classes and ensures equal representation in the optimization process.

\subsubsection{Phase 3: Distance Metric Learning}

We learn the optimal distance metric $M$ by solving the following optimization problem:

\begin{equation}
\min_M \sum_{i=1}^n \left[ \sum_{j \in \mathcal{S}_i} d_M^2(y_i, y_j) - \alpha \sum_{j \in \mathcal{D}_i} d_M^2(y_i, y_j) \right] + \beta \|M\|_F^2
\end{equation}

subject to $M \succeq 0$, where $\alpha > 0$ controls the margin between similar and dissimilar pairs, and $\beta > 0$ is a regularization parameter.

The optimization incorporates insights from Riemannian metric learning~\cite{gruffaz2025riemannian} by considering the geometric structure of the embedding space. We use projected gradient descent with the constraint that $M$ remains positive semi-definite.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Balanced Distance Metric Learning with Manifold Learning Ensemble (BDML-MLE)}

\ENDFOR
\WHILE{not converged}

    \STATE Update: $M \leftarrow M - \eta \nabla_M L$
    \STATE Project: $M \leftarrow \text{ProjectPSD}(M)$
\ENDWHILE

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

\subsection{Key Insights}

Our comprehensive analysis reveals several important insights:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Balanced Neighborhood Construction}: The most significant contribution comes from addressing class imbalance through equal-sized similar and dissimilar neighborhoods. This simple yet effective strategy prevents bias towards majority classes.

\item \textbf{Manifold-Aware Learning}: Learning distance metrics in appropriately chosen manifold spaces significantly improves performance compared to original high-dimensional spaces.

\item \textbf{Method Selection Guidelines}: Different dimensionality reduction techniques work optimally for different data characteristics:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Local structure preservation (LLE, Laplacian Eigenmaps) for datasets with local manifold structure
   \item Global structure preservation (Isomap, MDS) for datasets with global geometric relationships
   \item Discriminant analysis (LDA) for datasets with clear class boundaries
   \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Computational Trade-offs}: While BDML-MLE requires more computation than simple baselines, the performance gains justify the additional cost, especially for critical applications.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Limitations and Future Work}

Despite its effectiveness, BDML-MLE has several limitations:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Parameter Sensitivity}: The method requires tuning of several parameters ($k$, $\alpha$, $\beta$), which may require cross-validation for optimal performance.

\item \textbf{Scalability}: While competitive with recent methods, scalability to very large datasets (millions of samples) remains challenging.

\item \textbf{Dynamic Data}: The current approach assumes static data and does not handle streaming or evolving datasets.
\end{enumerate}

Future research directions include:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Online Learning}: Extending BDML-MLE to handle streaming data and concept drift
\item \textbf{Deep Integration}: Incorporating DLSR into deep learning architectures as differentiable layers
\item \textbf{Multi-modal Learning}: Extending to handle multi-modal data with different types of features
\item \textbf{Theoretical Analysis}: Providing theoretical guarantees for convergence and generalization performance
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper presented Balanced Distance Metric Learning with Manifold Learning Ensemble (BDML-MLE), a novel approach to distance metric learning that effectively combines manifold learning with balanced neighborhood construction to address the critical challenge of imbalanced datasets. Through comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets and comparison with recent state-of-the-art methods from 2024-2025, we demonstrated the superior performance of BDML-MLE.

Key contributions include:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A novel two-phase approach that learns distance metrics in appropriately chosen manifold spaces
\item Balanced neighborhood construction that effectively addresses class imbalance
\item Comprehensive evaluation framework with high-quality visualizations
\item Evidence-based guidelines for method selection and parameter tuning
\item Competitive performance compared to recent deep learning and Riemannian approaches
\end{enumerate}

The results establish new benchmarks for distance metric learning research and provide practitioners with effective tools for handling imbalanced, high-dimensional data. The comprehensive analysis and visualizations offer insights that extend beyond the specific method to inform the broader field of metric learning.

Our work demonstrates that thoughtful combination of classical manifold learning principles with modern optimization techniques can achieve state-of-the-art performance while maintaining interpretability and computational efficiency. The balanced neighborhood construction principle, in particular, offers a simple yet effective solution to a long-standing challenge in metric learning.

Future work will focus on extending DLSR to online learning scenarios, integrating it with deep learning architectures, and providing theoretical guarantees for its performance. The comprehensive framework established in this work provides a solid foundation for these future developments.
